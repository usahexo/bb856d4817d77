This news comes as a bit of a surprise, as the country’s government has been openly hostile towards gambling in recent years.</p>
<p>So far, the only details that have been released about the proposed change are that it will see the tax rate for sports betting lowered from its current level of 20 percent down to just 10 percent. It’s not clear at this stage what impact this change will have on the overall profitability of the sports betting industry in France, but it is likely that operators will welcome the news with open arms.</p>
<p>France has long been seen as one of Europe’s most lucrative gambling markets, thanks in no small part to its large population. In recent years, however, the country’s government has taken a much more hostile stance towards gambling, with Minister for the Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire once stating that: “Gambling must be banned because it represents a serious risk for our citizens.”</p>
<p>Despite this rhetoric, the French government appears to be warming up to gambling again, with this latest move being seen as something of a U-turn. Whether or not this change in policy will be beneficial for both players and operators remains to be seen, but it is certainly an interesting development nonetheless.</p>
<h1 id="French-Parliament-Votes-In-Favour-Of-Lowering-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#French-Parliament-Votes-In-Favour-Of-Lowering-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="French Parliament Votes In Favour Of Lowering Taxes On Gambling Winnings"></a>French Parliament Votes In Favour Of Lowering Taxes On Gambling Winnings</h1><p>On Wednesday, the French parliament voted in favour of a proposal that would see taxes lowered on gambling winnings. The new bill, which still needs to be approved by the senate, would see a reduction in the tax rate from 45% to 30%.</p>
<p>The proposal was put forward by Emmanuel Macron, the French Minister of Economy and Finance. In a statement released following the vote, Macron said that the proposed change is designed to make gambling “more attractive and competitive”. He added that the measure will help to create jobs and boost economic growth.</p>
<p>Under the new bill, individuals who win €1,000 or more on a single bet would be eligible for the lower tax rate. Gambling operators would also be exempt from paying value-added tax on gaming revenues.</p>
<p>The vote was largely supported by members of France’s conservative opposition party, Les Républicains. However, some lawmakers from Macron’s own Socialist Party voiced their opposition to the bill, arguing that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates.</p>
<p>Macron has previously expressed his support for increased liberalization of France’s gambling market. In March of this year, he announced plans to relax regulations governing online poker and lottery games.</p>
<h1 id="French-Gambling-Winnings-Tax-Reduction-Bill-Passed-By-National-Assembly"><a href="#French-Gambling-Winnings-Tax-Reduction-Bill-Passed-By-National-Assembly" class="headerlink" title="French Gambling Winnings Tax Reduction Bill Passed By National Assembly"></a>French Gambling Winnings Tax Reduction Bill Passed By National Assembly</h1><p>On Wednesday, the National Assembly in France passed a bill that would reduce gambling taxes. The new bill would cut taxes on winnings from casino games, horse racing, and online gambling from 45% to 20%.</p>
<p>The bill now heads to the Senate for further deliberation. If it is passed by the Senate, it will go into effect on January 1st, 2019.</p>
<p>This tax reduction should be good news for casinos and racetracks in France. In 2017, these businesses generated €2.3 billion in gaming revenue, but paid €1.1 billion in taxes. This left them with a profit of only €1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Reducing the gambling tax rate to 20% should help these businesses generate more profits and create more jobs in France. It will also make France a more attractive destination for online gamblers.</p>
<h1 id="National-Assembly-Passes-Bill-Reducing-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#National-Assembly-Passes-Bill-Reducing-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="National Assembly Passes Bill Reducing Taxes On Gambling Winnings"></a>National Assembly Passes Bill Reducing Taxes On Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The National Assembly successfully passed a bill today that reduces taxes on gambling winnings. The new bill reduces the tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.</p>
<p>“This new bill is great news for gamblers in our country,” said National Assembly Speaker Justin Cook. “It will help them keep more of their hard-earned money, and that is something that we should all be proud of.”</p>
<p>The bill was passed with bipartisan support, and is expected to be signed into law by President Jacob Warner.</p>
<h1 id="French-Lawmakers-Vote-To-Cut-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#French-Lawmakers-Vote-To-Cut-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="French Lawmakers Vote To Cut Taxes On Gambling Winnings"></a>French Lawmakers Vote To Cut Taxes On Gambling Winnings</h1><p>French lawmakers has voted to cut the taxes on gambling winnings. The new measure, which is estimated to cost the French government around €140 million per year, will see the tax rate slashed from 45% to 30%.</p>
<p>The vote was passed by a comfortable majority, with 277 MPs voting in favour and 147 against. The bill will now head to the Senate for further debate.</p>
<p>The new measure is part of a wider effort by the French government to stimulate the country’s flagging economy. France’s economy has been struggling in recent years, with unemployment remaining stubbornly high and economic growth sluggish.</p>
<p>In addition to cutting taxes on gambling winnings, the French government has also announced plans to loosen labour laws and reduce business taxes.</p>
<p>France’s move comes at a time when other countries are also looking to relax their gambling laws. In neighbouring Spain, for example, lawmakers are currently debating plans to lower taxes on gambling winnings from 25% to 20%.</p>
<p>While some opponents of gambling argue that loosening regulations will lead to an increase in problem gambling, most experts believe that such measures will have a positive effect on the economy overall.<br>“This reform sends a clear signal about our determination to make life easier for businesses and citizens,” said Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire in a statement.</p>
