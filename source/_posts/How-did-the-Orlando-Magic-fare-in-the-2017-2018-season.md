#  How did the Orlando Magic fare in the 2017-2018 season?

The Orlando Magic had a very disappointing 2017-2018 season. They finished the season with a record of 25-57, which was good for last place in the Southeast Division and the 12th worst record in the NBA. Although they did not make the playoffs, there were some bright spots for the Magic.

Some of the Magic's best players this season were Aaron Gordon, Evan Fournier, and Nikola Vucevic. Gordon was voted to be a starter in the 2018 NBA All-Star Game, and he averaged 17.6 points per game while shooting 36 percent from three-point range. Fournier averaged 17.8 points per game and shot 43 percent from three-point range, while Vucevic averaged 20.8 points per game and hauled in 11.0 rebounds per game.

The Magic's biggest weakness this season was their lack of defense. They allowed 108.3 points per game (26th in the NBA) and allowed their opponents to shoot 47 percent from the field (27th in the NBA). Their biggest contributor to this poor defensive performance was center Bismack Biyombo, who was acquired in a trade with the Charlotte Hornets midway through the season. Biyombo finished the season with a defensive rating of 116.7, which was by far the worst on the team.

Despite their poor record, there are some things that fans can be optimistic about for next season. The first is that Gordon and Fournier are both still young and have room to improve. The second is that they will have another high draft pick this year, which they can use to add another talented player to their roster. And finally, head coach Frank Vogel has already said that he expects improvement from his team next season and that he plans on holding everyone accountable for their play.

#  What offseason moves were made by the Magic?

After a disappointing season in which the Magic finished with a record of 25-57, the team made some changes in the offseason.

The first move was to fire head coach Frank Vogel and replace him with Steve Clifford. Vogel had been the head coach since 2016 and led the team to a winning record in his first season, but they regressed in each of the last two seasons. Clifford was most recently the head coach of the Charlotte Hornets and led them to playoff appearances in 2013-14 and 2016-17.

The Magic also made some changes to their roster, most notably signing free agent center Nikola Vucevic to a four-year, $100 million contract. Vucevic has been with the Magic since they drafted him in 2011 and is coming off of his best season yet, averaging 20.8 points and 12.0 rebounds per game.

Other notable signings include point guard Elfrid Payton to a one-year, $2 million contract and forward Terrence Ross to a three-year, $54 million contract. The Magic also traded for forward Jonathan Isaac and drafted guard Mohamed Bamba with the sixth overall pick in the NBA draft.

Overall, it seems like the Magic made some good moves this offseason and are hoping for a better result in 2018-19.

#  Who is the head coach of the Magic?

The head coach of the Magic is Steve Clifford. Clifford was previously the head coach of the Charlotte Hornets, and was hired by the Magic on May 29, 2018.

#  How did the Magic perform in the preseason?

The Orlando Magic finished the preseason with a 3-2 record. The highlight of their preseason was a 114-93 victory over the Miami Heat on October 10th.

While it is only preseason, the Magic looked very good in their victories and have shown promise for the upcoming season.

One of the biggest reasons for their early success has been the play of Nikola Vucevic. The 7’0” center is coming off his best season yet, in which he averaged 20.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game. He has continued his strong play into the preseason, averaging 17 points and 10 rebounds in six games.

In addition to Vucevic, Aaron Gordon has also been impressive this preseason. The 22-year-old averaged 18 points and 8 rebounds last season and has looked even better in the preseason, averaging 23 points and 9 rebounds in five games.

With Gordon and Vucevic leading the way, the Magic look like they could be one of the most improved teams in the NBA this season.

#  What are the expectations for the Magic in the 2018-2019 season?

The Magic had a disappointing season in 2017-2018, finishing with a record of 25-57. However, there is reason for optimism heading into the 2018-2019 season. Here are three things fans can expect from the Magic this season:

1) A better record - The Magic should be improved this season, thanks to the additions of Jonathan Isaac and Mo Bamba. With a young core that is only going to get better, the Magic should be able to win more games than they did last season.

2) More exciting plays - The young players on the Magic are very athletic and will make some exciting plays this season. Players like Isaac, Bamba, Aaron Gordon and Evan Fournier will provide fans with plenty of highlight reel material.

3) A playoff appearance - While it may not be likely, it is not impossible for the Magic to make the playoffs this season. With a good record and a little bit of luck, they could sneak in as the eighth seed.
