#  How To Make Money Playing Blackjack In Red Dead Redemption 2 

Making money in Red Dead Redemption 2 can be a tricky proposition. There are many different ways to try and make a dollar, but not all of them are easy. One of the best - and easiest - ways to make some quick cash is by playing blackjack in the game.

If you're unfamiliar with the rules of blackjack, don't worry; we're here to help. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. You can either hit (draw another card) or stand (keep the cards you have). The dealer also has two cards, and will draw another one if they get too close to 21. If the dealer goes over 21, then everyone still alive at the table wins!

The basic strategy for blackjack is to always take another card if your total is between 16 and 20; hit on totals of 11 or less, and stand on totals of 12 or more. Remember that you can also double down (double your bet, and receive only one more card) if you think you have a strong hand.

Now that you know how to play blackjack, it's time to learn how to make some money while playing! The most important thing is to find a table with friendly players - someone who isn't trying to take all of your money! Once you've found a good table, start by betting low - $1 or $2 per hand is a good place to start. If you lose your money quickly, don't be afraid to leave and try another table.

If things are going well and you're winning hands, then start upping your bets until you're betting $5 or $10 per hand. Remember that it's important to keep track of how much money you're spending - if you start losing money, it's best to quit while you're ahead!

Blackjack is a great way to make some extra cash in Red Dead Redemption 2, but it's important to remember that it's still gambling. Don't spend more money than you can afford to lose, and be sure to have fun while playing!

#  Michael Crichton's Secret Blackjack Method To Making A Profit! 

The first time I ever heard about Michael Crichton's secret blackjack method was in one of his books, " Rising Sun ." He mentioned that he had used it at a casino in Las Vegas and made a profit. The next time I heard about it was on one of the investment shows on television. A man by the name of Anthony Curtis was talking about how he had learned this method from Crichton himself.

Here's how it works. First you have to find a casino that offers a blackjack game with a six-deck shoe. Next, find a table that has a minimum bet of $10 and maximum bet of $500. Then, place your bet on the table in the betting circle and wait for the dealer to deal the cards. 

When the cards are dealt, you'll want to look at the first two cards that are dealt to you. If the first card is an Ace, then you'll want to take a card. If the second card is also an Ace, then you'll want to double your bet and stand. If the first card is not an Ace, then you'll want to hit until you get an Ace or until you go over 21 (which would be a bust). 

If your first two cards are not an Ace, then you'll want to stand if their total is 17 or more. If their total is 16 or less, then you'll want to hit. 

The basic strategy for this method is simple enough that anyone can do it without any practice whatsoever. And because there is no counting involved, even people who don't know how to count cards can use this method and still win money.

#  Red Dead Redemption 2: How To Win At Blackjack Every Time 


In the world of Red Dead Redemption 2, blackjack is a popular casino game that can be played in many different locations. The object of the game is to draw cards until you reach 21, or come as close as possible without going over. In this guide, we’ll teach you how to win at blackjack every time, whether you’re playing at a casino or in Story Mode. 

The first step to winning at blackjack is to understand the basic rules. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by drawing cards totalling more than 21, without going bust (going over 21). You can draw up to three cards per turn, and the aim is to beat the dealer's total without going over 21. If your total goes over 21, you bust and lose the round. 

Each card has a point value: 2 through 10 are face value, an Ace is worth 1 or 11 (player’s choice), and all face cards are worth 10 points. So, for example, if you were dealt an Ace and a 3, your total would be 14 (Ace=1+3=4; 4+10=14). If the dealer was dealt an Ace and a 4, their total would be 15 (Ace=1+4=5; 5+10=15). 

To start winning at blackjack every time, you need to make sure you’re always betting on black. This may seem like common sense, but it’s important to remember that red pays even money (1-1) while black pays double (2-1). So by betting on black every time, you’re ensuring that you get paid more when you win. 

The next step is to keep track of what cards have been played already. This can be done easily by marking each card with a symbol as it’s played. For example, use a ‘D’ for Diamonds and an ‘S’ for Spades. As each card is played, mark it off with either a ‘D’ or an ‘S’ accordingly. This way, you won’t forget which cards have been played and which ones are still in play. 

Now that you know how to win at blackjack every time and understand the basic rules of the game, let's go into more detail about how to play each hand: 

If you have an Ace and a 2 (or any other combination totalling 3), hit (draw another card). This hand totals 13 and should be hit again as long as there are no higher cards showing (e.g. if there was already a 5 on the table). If there are no other high cards showing on the table and your next card is also an Ace or 2 then stand (don't draw any more cards).

If you have an Ace and a 3 (total 4), hit again unless there are no other high cards showing on the table – in which case stand.

If you have two 4s or two Aces (total 8 or 12), hit again unless there are no other high cards showing on the table – in which case stand.

And so on…

#  How To Earn Money Fast Playing Blackjack In Red Dead Redemption 

If you're looking to make some quick cash in Red Dead Redemption, playing blackjack is a great way to do it. This guide will teach you the basics of the game and how to make money fast while playing.

To play blackjack in Red Dead Redemption, you'll first need to find a casino. There are several casinos located throughout the game world, and most of them have a blackjack table. Once you've found a casino, approach the table and press R1 to start playing.

The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. You can hit (take another card) or stand (end your turn) depending on your hand value. The dealer must hit on 16 or lower and stand on 17 or higher.

Here's a basic strategy chart that will help you make the best decisions while playing blackjack:

If your hand is... Then you should... 2 Double down if the dealer has 3-6 3 Split if the dealer has 2-7 4 Hit 5 Stand 6 Double down if the dealer has 3-6 7 Split if the dealer has 2-7 8 Hit 9 Stand 10 Double down if the dealer has 2-10 11 Hit 12 Stand 13 Hit 14 Stand 15 Hit 16 Stand 17 Stay 18 Hit 19 or 20 Double down or hit based on your own discretion

Once you've familiarized yourself with the basic rules of blackjack, it's time to start making some money. Here are three tips for winning big at the table:

1) Don't bet too much at once - It's important not to bet too much at once when playing blackjack, especially if you're new to the game. Start out by betting small amounts and gradually increase your bets as you get more comfortable with the game. This will help minimize your losses if you happen to lose a few hands in a row.

2) Use basic strategy - As discussed earlier, using basic strategy is key to winning at blackjack. If you're not confident enough in your abilities to make decisions on your own, use a strategy chart like the one provided earlier.

3) Bet on ties - One way to increase your chances of winning at blackjack is to bet on ties. This means that instead of betting on who will win between yourself and the dealer, you bet that they will tie instead. While this wager does have a higher house edge, it can be profitable if done correctly.

#  Blackjack Tips And Tricks From Michael Crichton

Blackjack is one of the casino games that offer the player a good chance of winning and has a low house edge. The following are some tips that can help increase your chances of winning at blackjack:

1) Choose a table that is not crowded. The more players at the table, the less likely it is you will win.

2) Make sure the dealer has a weak hand. If the dealer shows a two, three, four, five or six, stay in the game. If the dealer has any other card, hit.

3) Double down if you have 11 points.

4) Split pairs when possible. For instance, if you are dealt two eights, split them and play each as separate hands. This gives you twice as many chances to win money.

5) Stand on 17 points or higher.
