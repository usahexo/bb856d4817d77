#  How to tell if your loved one is addicted to gambling 

If you’re concerned that your loved one may be addicted to gambling, there are some telltale signs you can look out for. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, some of the most common symptoms of gambling addiction include:

* Feeling the need to gamble with more and more money in order to get the same rush
* Gambling despite negative consequences, such as financial problems, relationship issues or legal trouble
* Concealing gambling behavior from loved ones
* feeling moody or irritable when unable to gamble

If you’re worried that someone you care about is struggling with a gambling addiction, it’s important to talk to them about it. The first step is to express your concerns in a supportive way. Try not to judge or criticize them – simply let them know that you’re there for them and want to help.

In many cases, people who are addicted to gambling will deny that they have a problem. They may be in denial about how much money they’ve lost or how their gambling is affecting their life. In these cases, it may be necessary for loved ones to stage an intervention. An intervention is a confrontation in which friends and family members come together to confront the addict about their behavior and urge them to seek treatment.

If your loved one agrees to seek treatment, there are a variety of options available. Some people choose to participate in outpatient programs, while others may require more intensive treatment, such as inpatient rehab. The most important thing is that the addict gets help and support in order to break their addiction and return to healthy functioning.

#  5 signs your partner may have a gambling addiction

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can destroy relationships. If you’re worried that your partner may have a gambling addiction, here are five signs to look out for.

1. They gamble excessively

If your partner is gambling more than they can afford to lose, or spending more time gambling than usual, it’s a sign that they may have a problem.

2. They become secretive or defensive when you mention their gambling

If your partner becomes defensive or secretive when you ask them about their gambling, it could be because they know they have a problem and they’re trying to hide it from you.

If your partner starts acting out of character after losing money while gambling, it could be a sign that they’re addicted to the thrill of the game.

4. They make excuses to gamble

If your partner is always coming up with excuses to go to the casino or online betting site, it means that they’re using gambling as a way to avoid their problems and escape from reality.


5. Their behaviour changes drastically when they gamble

If your partner suddenly starts behaving irresponsibly or recklessly after starting to gamble, it could be an indication that their addiction has taken over their life.
