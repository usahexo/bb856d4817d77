#  Any Time Did Horseshoe Cincinnati Change To Jack Casino

It would be no secret the horseshoe Cincinnati had a name change to Jack Casino. Just what is the reason and when did it happen?

The Horseshoe Casino in downtown Cincinnati opened on March 4, 2013. It was a $350 million project that employed 1,700 people. The casino was owned by Rock Ohio Caesars, a joint venture between Rock Gaming and Caesar’s Entertainment. In early 2017, the casino was sold to JACK Entertainment, which also owns the Cleveland and Detroit casinos. As part of the sale agreement, the Horseshoe name was changed to Jack Casino Cincinnati. 

The official changeover took place at 5:00 am on March 1, 2017. All references to the Horseshoe Casino were replaced with Jack Casino Cincinnati. There were no major changes made to the casino itself, just the name. 

The reason for the name change is unknown. It could have been as simple as JACK Entertainment wanting its casinos to have the same name across all three markets. Or it could be that Jack Entertainment felt that the Horseshoe name wasn’t well known outside of Ohio. 

Whatever the reason may be, there’s no doubt that Jack Casino Cincinnati is here to stay. So whether you want to call it the Horseshoe or Jack Casino, either way you’re in for a good time!
