#  Illinois Online Casino Regulators Set Age Limit at 21

The Illinois Gaming Board has finalized regulations for the state's upcoming online casino industry, including an age limit of 21.

This limit is in line with the state's existing Brick and Mortar casinos, which also require patrons to be at least 21 years old in order to gamble.

In addition to the age requirement, the Board has also finalized regulations concerning how much money players can withdraw from their accounts on a single day. Players will be able to withdraw up to $1,000 per day.

While there is still some uncertainty about how the online casino industry will actually work in Illinois, these new regulations provide a basic framework for what players can expect when it launches later this year.

#  Illinois Online Casino Age Limit Set at 18

On Tuesday, the Illinois Senate approved a bill that would legalize gambling in the state and set the minimum age limit at 18. The vote was 41-17 in favor of the bill.

This is a big win for gambling proponents in Illinois, who have tried unsuccessfully for years to legalize casinos in the state. The bill now goes to the House for approval, where it is also expected to pass.

Governor Bruce Rauner has not said whether he will sign the bill into law, but he is generally supportive of gambling expansion.

If the bill is signed into law, Illinois will become the first state in the Midwest to legalize online casino gambling. The minimum age limit for online casino gambling would be 21.

The legislation would also allow for six new casinos to be built in Illinois, as well as sports betting at race tracks and on mobile devices.

The measure is expected to bring in $300 million annually in new revenue for the state.

#  Illinois Online Casinos Prohibit Gambling Under 21

Illinois is one of the few states in the US that has yet to legalize online gambling, and this week there was a push to prohibit gambling by those under 21. The effort is being led by Rep. Lou Lang (D-Skokie), who said it’s important to protect those who are “most vulnerable”.

Representative Greg Harris (D-Chicago) also voiced his support, saying that he doesn’t want children getting into trouble with gambling at such a young age. However, the proposal faces an uphill battle in the legislature, as Republicans have shown little interest in supporting it.

This isn’t the first time that lawmakers in Illinois have attempted to address the issue of online gambling. In fact, a similar proposal was introduced last year but it failed to gain traction. One of the main reasons for this is likely the fact that casinos and racetracks in Illinois are already struggling to compete with casinos in neighboring states.

Supporters of online gambling argue that it could be a major boost to the state economy, generating millions of dollars in revenue. However, opponents point to the potential for addiction and other negative consequences. Regardless of where you stand on the issue, it’s clear that legalizing online gambling is a complicated process that won’t be resolved anytime soon.

#  Illinois Online Casino Age Limit Ruled Unconstitutional

On Thursday, June 14th, 2018, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the state’s law prohibiting anyone under 21 from gambling online is unconstitutional. The unanimous decision overturns a previous ruling by a lower court.

The case was brought to court by casino operator DoubleU Games and three players who were all over 18 but younger than 21 when they tried to gamble on the company’s website. DoubleU has been blocked from operating in Illinois since the law came into effect in 2012.

In its ruling, the justices said that the casino age limit violates the constitutional rights of adults 18-20 years old “to make contracts and to engage in other private pursuits for which this age group is otherwise qualified.” They also ruled that the law does not serve the state’s interest in protecting minors.

While this is good news for DoubleU and other casinos looking to operate in Illinois, it’s unclear what kind of impact it will have on gambling habits among young people in the state. It’s possible that with this ruling, more young people will start gambling online, but it’s also possible that they will just continue to gamble illegally.

Since the law was overturned, several other states including New York, Massachusetts, and Michigan have passed similar laws barring anyone under 21 from gambling online. It will be interesting to see if these states decide to revisit their laws in light of the Illinois Supreme Court ruling.

#  Illinois Supreme Court Sets Minimum Age for Gambling in Online Casinos at 21

The Illinois Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the minimum age for gambling in online casinos is 21.

The case was brought by a Chicago woman who argued that the law allowing 18-year-olds to gamble in casinos should apply to online gambling as well. But the court sided with Attorney General Lisa Madigan, who said the state has a strong interest in protecting consumers from fraud and other problems associated with gambling.

Madigan also said that young people are more likely to develop compulsive gambling habits and that Illinois has a duty to protect them.

The ruling overturns a lower court decision that allowed 18-year-olds to gamble in online casinos.
