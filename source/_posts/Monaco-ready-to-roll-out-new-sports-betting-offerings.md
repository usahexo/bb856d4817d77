#  Monaco ready to roll out new sports betting offerings

Monaco’s Gaming Commission has given the green light to a number of new sports betting products, which will soon be available to players in the principality.

The move is part of Monaco’s plan to attract new players and increase its market share in the sports betting sector. The products that have been approved include a wide range of innovative offerings, such as In-Play betting, Virtual Sports and Betting on Mobile devices.

In-Play betting allows players to bet on games as they are taking place, while Virtual Sports simulate the experience of watching a real sporting event online. Betting on Mobile devices gives punters the chance to bet on the go, using their smartphones or tablets.

These new products are expected to be rolled out in the near future, with industry insiders tipping them to be a big success. Monaco’s Gaming Commission Chairman Jean-Luc Butel voiced his excitement at the prospect of these products being made available to players in Monaco.

Butel said: “We are very enthusiastic about this new offering, which is sure to appeal to both our existing and new customers. We believe it will help us further expand our market share in the sports betting sector and generate even more revenue for the government.”

The news comes shortly after the launch of a new online casino by Monaco-based gaming company Geely Holding Group Co Ltd. The casino, called Casino des Palmiers, offers players a wide range of slots and table games from leading providers such as NetEnt and Microgaming.

CASINOS IN MONACO GEAR UP FOR SPORTS BETTING AHEAD OF SUPER BOWL

Monaco’s casinos are preparing for an influx of sports bettors ahead of this year’s Super Bowl. The famed Casino de Monte Carlo is one of the gaming establishments getting ready for the big game, which will be played on Sunday, February 3.

The casino has put together a special package that includes a welcome drink, a betting guide, and information about where to watch the game. It is also offering exclusive promotions on the day of the Super Bowl, including a chance to win a trip to Las Vegas.

Other casinos in Monaco are also getting ready for the Super Bowl. The Casino de la Lagune is offering a betting guide and free drinks to players who make a minimum bet of €10 ($11.50). The Fairmont Monte Carlo has created a special “Super Bowl Corner” where guests can watch the game and place bets.

While gambling is not technically legal in Monaco, it is tolerated as long as it does not cause any public disturbances. This means that casino-goers can legally place bets on sporting events, although online gambling is not allowed.

The Super Bowl is the biggest annual sporting event in the United States, with millions of people placing bets on the outcome. The total amount wagered on last year’s game was estimated at $138 million, and it is likely that this year’s Super Bowl will generate even more betting action.

Casinos in Monaco are hoping to capitalize on this by offering special promotions and by making it easy for visitors to place bets. They are expecting a surge of business from sports bettors during the week leading up to the Super Bowl, and they are confident that they will be able to handle the influx of traffic.
