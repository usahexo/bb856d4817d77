#  PA Casino Workers Win Labor Dispute, DS Means $2 an Hour Extra

Pennsylvania casino dealers will soon be making $2 an hour more after successfully winning a labor dispute. The Pennsylvania Dealers’ Service (DS) union, who represents the dealers, announced that they had reached a tentative agreement with the five casino operators in the state late Friday night.

The new agreement means that dealers will now make at least $11 an hour, with some earning up to $15 an hour based on their experience and job duties. This is a big win for the DS union, which has been fighting for years to get better pay and benefits for its members.

Dealers are responsible for running games like blackjack and poker and providing customer service. They are also often the first point of contact for customers when they enter a casino, so it’s important that they are paid a fair wage.

In addition to the higher wages, the new agreement includes better healthcare benefits and pension plans. It also includes a provision that would allow dealers to continue working until they reach retirement age, rather than being forced to retire at 65.

This is great news for the 2,000 dealers who work in Pennsylvania casinos. It’s also good news for casino customers, who can now expect to be serviced by happy and well-paid employees.

#  Pennsylvania Slots Payout Nearly 96%, But What Does DS Mean?

Slot machines in Pennsylvania returned nearly 96% of the money wagered in May, according to data released Thursday by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. But what does that mean for casino players?

The payout percentage, also called the return to player or RTP, is computed by dividing the total amount paid back to players by the total amount wagered. This means that for every dollar put in, about 96 cents is paid out in winnings.

This rate has been pretty consistent over the years in Pennsylvania casinos. In fact, the statewide payout was 95.84% in May 2017 and 95.92% in May 2016.

Return to player rates aren't generally released to the public, so it's interesting to get a glimpse into how much casinos are paying out on slots.

It's important to keep in mind that this statistic doesn't take into account how much players have won or lost on any given day. So if you happen to hit a jackpot, your individual return would be much higher than 96%.

But on average, casinos are shelling out nearly 96 cents on the dollar. So what does that mean for casino players?

For some people, it might mean they're more likely to win when they play slots. But for others, it could simply be an indication that the casino has good odds and they're more likely to walk away with at least some of their money still in their pocket.

In any case, it's always important to do your research before playing slots or any other casino game. Make sure you understand the game you're playing and know what your chances are of winning – or losing – money.

#  Pennsylvania Amusement Tax Could Mean the End of Slot Machines

The Pennsylvania Amusement Tax, which was passed in 2004 and went into effect in 2006, could very well mean the end of slot machines in the state. The tax, which is a 10% levy on gross receipts from all types of amusements and admissions, including slot machines, has caused many casinos to close their doors.

The tax was designed to help the state government bring in more revenue, but it has had the opposite effect. In fact, the tax has resulted in a net loss of revenue for the state government. This is because the casinos have closed down, and with them, the jobs and revenue that they brought in.

In addition to causing casino closures, the amusement tax has also led to a decline in tourism. This is because people are less likely to visit a state that has such a high amusement tax. As a result, Pennsylvania is losing out on money that could be used to fund schools, roads, and other important initiatives.

There is hope, however, that the amusement tax will be repealed or reduced in size. Recently, there have been talks of repealing the tax altogether, and this could happen as soon as next year. If this happens, it will be a huge victory for the casino industry and for Pennsylvania taxpayers.

#  What Does DS Mean on a Blackjack Strategy Card in Pennsylvania?

DS is an abbreviation for “double down.” When you see DS on a blackjack strategy card in Pennsylvania, it means that you are allowed to double your bet after the first two cards have been dealt.

#  Pennsylvania Set to Legalize Online Gambling

Pennsylvania is on the verge of becoming the fourth US state to legalize online gambling, joining Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. The state Senate has already approved a bill that would allow licensed casinos in Pennsylvania to offer online poker, slots, and other casino games to residents of the state.

The House of Representatives is expected to pass the bill as well, and Governor Tom Wolf has said he will sign it into law. Online gambling is expected to bring in an additional $200 million per year in tax revenue for Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania first legalized online gambling in 2017, but the regulations were so restrictive that no casinos took advantage of them. The new bill would loosen those restrictions, allowing casinos to partner with offshore operators and offer a wider range of games.

Pennsylvania is one of the most densely populated states in the US, with a population of over 12 million. The addition of online gambling will give residents another way to gamble and could help bolster the casino industry in Pennsylvania.
