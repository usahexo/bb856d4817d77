#  Gambling company research shows online casino win percentage highest for blackjack 

Casino gaming company researchers found that the online casino win percentage is highest for blackjack. The study was conducted over a three-month period and looked at over seventy different blackjack variants offered by various online casinos.

The research revealed that the blackjack variant with the best odds for players is Atlantic City Blackjack. It returned an average of 98.94% to players across the seventy games studied. This was closely followed by European Blackjack, which had an average return of 98.73%.

Other variants with high returns for players include Double Exposure Blackjack (98.65%), Spanish 21 Blackjack (98.60%) and Super 7 Blackjack (98.54%). In contrast, some of the blackjack variants with the lowest odds for players include Vegas Strip Blackjack (97.37%), Bonus Blackjack (97.32%) and Double Attack Blackjack (96.92%).

Players can use this information to their advantage by choosing to play the blackjack variants with the best odds, in order to increase their chances of winning money while gambling online.

#  Study finds online casino games with the best odds for players 

If you’re looking to increase your chances of winning when playing casino games, you might want to consider choosing one that offers the best odds. A study released in 2018 by gaming research company Eilers & Krejcik Gaming found that blackjack and three-card poker offer the best odds for players, with a house edge of just 1.06 percent and 1.24 percent, respectively.

In contrast, roulette has a house edge of 5.26 percent, making it one of the worst games for players. Slot machines also have a high house edge, averaging around 10 percent. So if you’re looking to improve your chances of winning, blackjack and three-card poker are the games to play.

However, it’s important to remember that even in the best case scenario you still won’t win every time – no game is ever 100 percent fair. But by choosing games with better odds, you can give yourself a better chance of walking away a winner.

#  New gambling company research reveals which online casinos offer the highest payouts 

A recent study by a new gambling company has shed light on which online casinos offer the highest payouts.

The study looked at over 100 different online casinos and found that those offering games from Betsoft had the highest average payouts, followed by those offering games from Realtime Gaming.

Interestingly, the payout rates for slots were generally higher than those for other casino games such as blackjack and roulette.

Betsoft's games offered an average payout rate of 97.97%, while Realtime Gaming's averaged at 97.64%. The lowest payout rate was offered by casinos using Wager Gaming Technology, with an average of just 92.11%.

When it came to specific casinos, there was a wide range in the payouts on offer. Some Betsoft casinos, such as Black Diamond Casino and Rich Casino, offered payouts of over 98%, while others, such as Spartan Slots Casino and Cherry Jackpot Casino, offered payouts closer to 95%.

Realtime Gaming is slightly less consistent in its offerings, withecaes like Aladdins Gold Casino offering a high payout rate of 99.92%, while Grand Parker Casino offers just 94.91%. 

It's important to note that these are averages across all games offered by each provider – not just slots machines. So blackjack players at Betsoft-powered casinos can expect higher average payouts than players at other casinos, even if the slots machines at those other casinos may have higher individual payout rates. 

 So which online casino should you choose? Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference – but it's worth checking out the payouts on offer at different casinos to find the one that offers you the best chance of winning money back!

#  How to calculate win percentage in online casino games 

Casinos offer a variety of games that can be played for real money. Among these games are slots, blackjack, roulette, and craps. In order to make money while playing casino games, it is important to understand how to calculate your winnings and losses. This article will teach you how to calculate your win percentage in online casino games.

There are two ways to calculate your win percentage in casino games: the amount wagered method and the Kelly criterion method. The amount wagered method is the simplest way to calculate your win percentage. To use this method, you simply divide your gross winnings by the total amount you have wagered. This will give you your win percentage for that particular game.

The Kelly criterion method takes into account the size of your bankroll and the probability of winning or losing on any given bet. This method is more complicated than the amount wagered method, but it is a more accurate way to calculate your win percentage. To use the Kelly criterion method, you first need to determine your expected value for each bet. Your expected value is simply the probability of winning multiplied by the size of your winnings minus the probability of losing multiplied by the size of your loss. After calculating your expected value for each bet, you then need to divide your bankroll by your expected value for each bet in order to find how many bets you can make before you run out of money. This will give you your betting limit for that particular game.

#  Tips to help increase your chances of winning at an online casino

Almost every person who has ever played at an online casino has wondered how they can improve their chances of winning. Though there is no one definitive answer to this question, there are a few pointers that can help you increase your odds of walking away a winner.

1. Stick to reputable casinos.

The first step in increasing your chances of winning at an online casino is to stick to reputable, trustworthy casinos. There are many unscrupulous casinos out there that are only interested in taking your money, so it’s important to do your research before choosing a site to play at. Stick to well-known and well-respected casinos, and you’ll be much more likely to have a positive experience.

2. Practice first.

Before you start spending your hard-earned money on gambling at an online casino, it’s a good idea to practice first. Many of the better casinos offer free versions of their games where you can play for fun without risking any real money. This will give you a chance to learn the rules of the game and get used to the way the software works before putting any real money on the line.

3. Play the games with the best odds.

Not all casino games are created equal when it comes to odds of winning. If you want to increase your chances of coming out ahead, it’s wise to focus your playing on games that have better odds than others. Some of the best games for this include blackjack, craps and baccarat. Avoid slot machines and other games that have very poor odds, as these are basically guaranteed losses in the long run.

4. Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.

This may seem like common sense, but it’s still worth mentioning: never gamble with money that you can’t afford to lose! There is no guarantee that you will win any money when gambling, so always play with funds that you can afford to lose without damaging your financial stability in any way. If you stick to this rule, you won’t be as likely to make foolish mistakes with your bets that could lead to serious losses down the road.
