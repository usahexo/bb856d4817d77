#  Lawmakers Ban Sports Betting at Jet Casino over Concerns about Gambling Addiction 

The New Jersey state Senate banned sports betting at the Jet Casino earlier this week in response to concerns about gambling addiction. Democratic State Sen. James Beach, who sponsored the bill, cited statistics from the National Council on Problem Gambling that showed more than two million people in the United States are addicted to gambling.

"The Senate today unanimously voted to prevent any new casinos from opening up sports books in order to protect our residents and communities from the scourge of gambling addiction," said Beach in a statement. "This is an important step to prevent potentially harmful effects on individuals and their families."

Republican State Sen. Jim Whelan, who also sponsored the bill, agreed with Beach's assessment, adding that "gambling addiction is a real problem that destroys families." The ban will take effect immediately and apply to all new casinos, including the $2 billion Revel Casino which is set to open later this year.

Supporters of the bill believe it will help reduce gambling addiction rates in New Jersey, which are currently among the highest in the country. Opponents of the measure argue that it will reduce tax revenue for the state and cost jobs.

#  New Jersey Legislature Bans Sports Betting at Jets Casino 

The Jets Casino, located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, will no longer offer sports betting services as a result of the state’s new legislation. The ban was announced on Monday by New Jersey state legislators and is part of a wider effort to prohibit all forms of sports betting in the state.

The Jets Casino is one of five casinos in Atlantic City that will be affected by the ban. Other casinos include the Borgata, Caesars, Harrah’s, and Trump Taj Mahal. In a statement, state senator James Whelan said that the ban is necessary to protect the integrity of sporting events.

“We cannot allow our citizens to place bets on sporting events with unregulated and unscrupulous offshore entities,” said Whelan. “This legislation will help ensure the integrity of sporting events while also contributing to the stability of our casino industry.”

The legislation does not affect horse racing or other forms of gambling that are already legal in New Jersey. It also does not apply to online sports betting, which is regulated by the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement.

Opponents of the ban say that it will cost the state jobs and revenue. They argue that New Jersey should follow the lead of Delaware, which recently passed a law allowing limited sports betting at its three casinos.

#  Bills Passed in Assembly and Senate Ban Sports Betting at Jets Casino 

The state Assembly and Senate both passed a bill on Thursday that would ban sports betting at the Jets casino in downtown Albany.

The ban was proposed by state Sen. Jim Tedisco, who said he was worried about the potential for corruption if sports betting were allowed at the casino. The bill now goes to Gov. Andrew Cuomo for his signature.

A spokesman for the governor said in a statement that Cuomo "will review the legislation carefully."

Supporters of the ban say it's necessary to prevent gambling addiction and other negative consequences. But critics argue that banning sports betting at the Jets casino will simply send people to illegal bookmakers and black markets.

This is just the latest controversy surrounding the Jets casino. Earlier this year, there was dispute over how much revenue the state would receive from the casino.

#  Legislators Vote to Ban Sports Betting at Jets Casino 

Atlantic City, NJ - Tuesday, Feb. 26 - In a close vote, the New Jersey state legislators voted to ban sports betting at Jets Casino in Atlantic City. The vote was 26-24, with one abstention. 

The bill's main sponsor, Senator Declan O'Scanlon (R-Monmouth), said that he was "disappointed" by the outcome of the vote. "This bill would've brought jobs and additional tax revenue to our state," he said in a statement. "It's unfortunate that my colleagues couldn't see past their political agendas and vote for what's best for New Jersey." 

Countering O'Scanlon's argument is Assemblyman Vincent Mazzeo (D-Atlantic), who says that the ban is necessary to protect consumers from potential corruption. "This isn't about jobs or tax revenue," Mazzeo said in a statement. "It's about ensuring that the integrity of our sporting events is not compromised. I'm glad my colleagues saw fit to support this important measure." 

Senator Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic) also voiced his support for the ban, saying that it would help keep Atlantic City competitive with facilities in other states. "We can't let other states corner the market on sports betting," Whelan said in a statement. "This ban will help us maintain our edge and keep people coming to Atlantic City." 

The bill now heads to Governor Chris Christie's desk for his signature.

#  NJ Lawmakers Ban Sports Betting at Jets Casino as a Safeguard Against Gambling Addiction

The New Jersey State Legislature has voted to ban sports betting at the Jets-owned casino in Atlantic City, as a safeguard against gambling addiction.

The measure was passed in response to concerns that the casino could become a magnet for problem gamblers. "We don't want the Jets casino to become the new Las Vegas," said one lawmaker.

Supporters of the ban argued that it would protect vulnerable people from developing gambling addictions, and would also help to preserve the integrity of the state's gaming industry.

Opponents of the ban dismissed it as unnecessary and overly restrictive, arguing that responsible adults should be allowed to make their own decisions about whether to bet on sports.

In the end, however, the ban was passed by a wide margin, with 27 votes in favor and just 8 against. It will now go before Governor Phil Murphy for his signature.
